    "For me art is a way to give back. A means to reflect and process those impressions and events that life has given to me. When i paint i discover connections and patterns in my subjective experience of the world, and i am driven to try to convey those revelations through intuitive compositions that finds forms on my canvases.",
    "I am inspired by many things but above all by nature and the people around me and by the light that constantly creates new shades and moods. The drama and mystery but also the simplicity that lives in nature and how we are affected by it. It is interesting what happens to us when we are in nature. What is natural for us. And unnatural.",
    "In my art i want to let my inner child come out and play, the part of me that sees no limitations, who is curious and brave, who is experimental and tries new things. When i paint i want to capture those moments of magic and timelessness, let the paint drip and give life ti something you can’t put words to. Sometimes i work with photos and collage. Sometimes with materials and leather to create more structure in the images.",
    "Every day is an exploration and an act of balance between light and dark, colour and form."
