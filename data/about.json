    "I was born in Gothenburg in 1975. I have traveled and lived in many countries, studied, exhibited and performed. Im currently living and working on Brännö island outside Gothenburg.",
    "I like to see my art as a reflection of my life. What i love i paint. What i am going through i also process in my art. Sometimes i dance, or sing, or write, but painting is the medium where i feel most at home. I love to capture beautiful moments, sometimes i take photographs and let them be my inspiration. Other times i let myself go on inward journeys and I use symbols and dreams and i let images reveal themselves on the canvas. I also like to be experimental and use different materials in mixed media collage, sometimes i cut apart old paintings and make new images, as a process where destruction can be an important part of the creation",
    "I am interested in making more public art, to reach all kinds of people and as a way to make the world around us more colorful and inspiring."
